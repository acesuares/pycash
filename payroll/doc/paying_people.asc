Paying Salaries
It has been said that Canada is a part of the USA with the good sense not to pay taxes to Washington.  However, we pay taxes to Ottawa, so it comes out even in the end, especially since Ottawa doesn't do anything useful for us either. ;-)

GNU Cash doesn't have an integrated Payroll system.  In a small business with one or two employees, the payroll transactions can be handled manually quite easily though.  In Canada, the CCRA is actually very nice about it and provides a dinky little program that you can download off their web site, called Windows Tables On Disk.  This program can be used to prepare pay slips, so you are spared the ordeal of looking CPP, EI, Federal and Provincial taxes up in dead tree tables.  Be sure to get this program and update it twice a year from the CCRA web site.  The CCRA WTOD program can run on wine/cxoffice - I think - haven't tried that.  Where to get it? www.Google.ca will find it.  It is free, which is about the only good thing about it.

In order to do a payroll manually, you have to understand the basics about Canadian payroll taxes.  If you don't live in Canada, then don't worry, your system can only be simpler, so it will be easy to adapt this description.

These are the Payroll Tax Tracking Accounts in the sample Chart of Accounts:

    CPP Witholding - Canada Pension Plan witheld at source.  A pyramid scheme that is supposed to provide a small old age pension.  As with most pyramid schemes it is best avoided.
    EI Witholding - Employment Insurance witheld at source.  A tax used to repay the Federal deficit, with the pretense to  provide payments to laid off workers, widely abused by seasonal workers.
    Fed Witholding - Federal pay as you earn tax, witheld at source.
    Prov Witholding - Provincial pay as you earn tax, witheld at source.
    CPP Company - Corporate share of CPP, to make the employee think that he is paying less CPP than he actually is - equal to employee share.
    EI Company - Corporate share of EI, to make the employee think that he is paying less EI than he actually is - 1.4 times the employee share.

Under the Taxes accounts, you'll notice another pair:

    CPP Company
    EI Company

which balance their counterparts above.  Once you write a cheque you'll see what happens.  Don't worry, it really is quite confusing. ;-)

Lets say you have run WTOD, entered a monthly Gross Salary amount for your secretary and clicked Print Screen to get a paper copy of the pay slip, with the following results:

    Gross Salary: $2860.76
    CPP deductions: $127.17
    EI deductions: $60.08
    Fed tax: $336.60
    Prov tax: $155.95
    Net amount: $2180.96

Don't forget the stealth payroll tax that doesn't appear on the pay slip:

    CPP company: $127.17
    EI company: $60.08 * 1.4 = $84.11

Now, we can write the secretary a cheque.  We do this with a huuuuge split transaction.  We enter her Gross Salary, then subtract all the payroll taxes, then subtract the company part of the payroll taxes and then add the company part of payroll taxes back in again, since the company is supposed to pay it, not the secretary - confused? Good. 

The above ins and outs sound like a cricket game, but it allows us to create double entries for everything, right from the cheque writing dialogue.  Then when we pay the witholding taxes, all the amounts are already visible and you can write a cheque to the Receiver General for the total.

Here we go:

    On the Chart of Accounts, double click Checking CAD.
    Start a new entry and type Secretary Salary May for instance in the Description field, then click Split.
    Click in the memo field and type Gross Salary, the Account field should be Payroll:Salaries & Wages and in the Receive field type 2860.76, then press Tab
    Click in the next memo field and type Fed Witholding, in the Account field select Payroll:Fed Witholding and in the Spend field type 336.60, then press Tab
    Click in the next memo field and type Prov Witholding, in the Account field select Payroll:Prov Witholding and in the Spend field type 155.95, then press Tab
    Click in the next memo field and type CPP Witholding, in the Account field select Payroll:CPP Witholding and in the Spend field type 127.17, then press Tab
    Click in the next memo field and type EI Witholding, in the Account field select Payroll:EI Witholding and in the Spend field type 60.08, then press Tab
    Click in the next memo field and type CPP Company, in the Account field select Payroll:CPP Company and in the Spend field type 127.17, then press Tab

    Click in the next memo field and type CPP Company, in the Account field select Taxes:CPP Company and in the Receive field type 127.17, then press Tab twice
    Click in the next memo field and type EI Company, in the Account field select Taxes:EI Company and in the Receive field type 84.11, then press Tab twice
    Click in the next memo field and type Net Salary, in the Account field select Current Assets:Chequing CAD and in the Spend field you should have 2180.96 left
    Finally click Enter and the whole catastrophe should balance and GNU Cash will rearrange all your carefully entered lines.
